![App Screenshot](https://sites.psu.edu/shinyapps/files/2018/11/2c236341e55cf8638f1e17d3dff91fcbbcf7fdf5-satcapture-24ymx3h.png)

The app requires students to engage with inference scenarios for a mean (or difference in means) in context. Users will explore the behavior of confidence intervals for a single mean and two sample tests for the difference in means as the level and sample size changes.
